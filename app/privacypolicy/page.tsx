          <p>
            We shall not be responsible for any faults conducted by our client
            in safeguarding their information. Some of the instances would be
            when they share a computer with some other person, leaving the
            browser window open after use, when using a computer in public
            place, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our diligent management staff is rigorously working on solving and
            answering our client’s queries. Any request for updating, deleting
            or editing client’s information shall be put to effect as soon as

          <p>
            With internet being exposed to multiple risks and damages like virus
            attacks, hacking events or other means of unauthorized access, its
            stability cannot be guaranteed. In such cases, Rishikul Yogshala
            will not be held responsible for any loss, misuse or theft of
            personal information of the clients. But the same, if noticed by any
            client should be brought to notice of the management staff
            immediately. Strict action including investigation or any other
            legal action would be undertaken immediately. While we could be
            contacted via email, telephone services are considered to be a
            better medium, as the email services might be under observation of
            authority of hacker or a third party invader. In such cases as well,
            Rishikul Yogshala is not responsible for loss or divulging of
            personal information of the client.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inherent nature of the time cannot be reversed. Similarly in
            case of any merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale or dissolution
            of personal assets of Rishikul Yogshala, the client’s information,
            which is an asset to the company, will be shared, transferred or
            given away. With taking services from Rishikul Yogshala we assume
            your consent in the same.

            Especially in case when they plan to make any further communication
            or further stay with us for a course. In case of any large or
            material change, the company would undertake steps to inform the
            clients about the same.
